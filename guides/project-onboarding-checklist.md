## Onboarding your Open Project
This document is intended to give you a high-level understanding of the onboarding process and steps to become an Open Project. For a closer look and more guidance on each step, take a look at the [Getting Started Guide][get-start]. You can also copy this checklist to mark steps off as you complete them.


### 1. Submitting your Open Project application

- [ ] Request a [charter template][charter] in your preferred format: Google Doc, Markdown, or word processing file. 

- [ ] Work collaboratively with your community shareholders to craft your OP charter. 

- [ ] Identify & recruit the initial Project leadership who will make up your PGB and TSC. PGB members will need to sign an [Entity CLA](../policy/clas-and-special-covenant.md), so make sure to circulate that as well. If you want to recruit from outside your existing community, OASIS staff can assist with outreach. 

- [ ] Discuss any specific requirements your project may have with OASIS staff (e.g. resources, infrastructure requirements, special software needs, etc.) 

- [ ] Submit the final version of your charter to OASIS when project sponsors and leadership are ready. 

- [ ] Work with OASIS to determine timeline to launch your Open Project. You may want to consider major industry events, fiscal calendars, project bandwidth issues, or other important factors when creating this timeline.


### 2. Setting up your project's assets

- [ ] Assess any existing project assets - review repositories, websites, mailing lists, social media accounts, and other digital assets associated with the project.  

- [ ] If assets are missing or gaps are identified, work with OASIS to set up project resources or bring in any existing assets you need.

- [ ] If you are bringing in an existing website or other resources, review our [website guidelines](./project-website-guidelines.md) and determine what modifications will be needed meet OASIS Open Projects requirements.

- [ ] Confer with OASIS on your GitHub and project organization strategy:
	- You can create a new GitHub organization or confer with OASIS if you have an existing structure that you prefer to keep in place
	- Also review other assets such as webpages, social media presence, mailing lists, etc. 

### 3. Announcing your OASIS Open Project

- [ ] During the interim stage, after the final charter has been submitted and accepted, feel free to communicate openly about project acceptance with interested parties, via social media, email lists, etc. 
	- You're also welcome to talk openly about your intention to participate and invite others to join you in that conversation. The important part is being clear about whether the project has been accepted. 
	- Feel free to include pointers to OASIS staff in your announcements 

- [ ] Once the infrastructure is in place for your community, work with the OASIS team to draft official announcements for OASIS members and your the project community. 

- [ ] Optionally, you can also work with the OASIS team to issue press announcements or solicit media coverage.
