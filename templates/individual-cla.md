## OASIS Open Projects: Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
[This is a verbatim display exhibit of the Web form, supplemented by several hyperlinks]

In order to contribute intellectual property into an [OASIS Open Project](https://www.oasis-open-projects.org/), you must agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement ("CLA"), so that it is clear what terms apply to your intellectual property contributions. This is a license by you as an individual, for your protection as a contributor as well as for the protection of OASIS Open and all who use the donated material. You are required to agree to this CLA before you contribute to any repository maintained by an OASIS Open Project. You can do so by completing the online form below.

**Employer or affiliation information, if relevant**

For a corporation, organization or other entity that has assigned employees or contractors to contribute to an OASIS Open Project, an Entity CLA also should be used for contributing any intellectual property owned by that entity. Signing of an Entity CLA does not remove the need for every developer or contributor to sign their own CLA as an individual, to cover any contributions not owned by the entity signing the Entity CLA.

Please provide your employer's or organization's name, if you are contributing material as part of your employment or engagement with them:

**Agreement to License**

This CLA applies to all material ("**Contributions**"), including any original work of authorship and any modifications or additions to an existing work, that you send, post or otherwise explicitly submit for inclusion in any OASIS Open Project, now and in the future. OASIS Open Projects are governed by the OASIS Open Project Rules, which may also affect the application of this CLA.

You agree to license all of your rights in each of your Contributions, under the terms of the specific "**Applicable License**" designated on the home page of the repository into which it is submitted, for the benefit of both OASIS and all later parties who that Applicable License benefits. Subject to the terms of this CLA, and without limiting the terms of the Applicable License, you also hereby grant to OASIS a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license (with the right to directly and indirectly sublicense) to prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute each of your Contributions and such derivative works that Implement Or Derive From those Contributions (as defined in the Open Project Rules), and enable the implementation of the same by other parties.

You additionally agree to the terms of the **Specification NonAssertion Covenant** set forth in the Open Project Rules, with respect to any claims licensable by you that are described in that covenant, on the terms and conditions set forth there, which apply in some cases to all contributors and in other cases only to Project Governing Board members. That covenant may be withdrawn or terminated by you as provided by those terms.

This is a license and nonassertion agreement only; it does not transfer ownership, and does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. You understand that OASIS, its members and the users of its Open Projects are not required to make any use of your Contributions. You represent that you have the all of the legal rights necessary to license each of your Contributions under the terms of the Applicable License and this CLA. If you are employed or are contributing your work-for-hire supplied to another party, you also represent that you have received any necessary permissions from your employer or that party to submit your Contributions and grant those licenses.

Please note that you are responsible for assuring that your employer or that Party has executed an Entity CLA with OASIS, if their rights are contributed, and that an Open Project may choose to decline your contributions if those arrangements are not in place. If any part of your Contribution incorporates the original work of another party, you also represent that you have received all necessary rights and permissions from them to make the Contribution under the terms of the Applicable License.

**Information and Disclosure**

You agree that all OASIS Open Projects and their repositories are public, and that a record of your Contributions, including your identifying information and notices provided with them and in this CLA, may be permanently maintained and freely redistributed. OASIS guidelines and procedures for its Open Projects can be found at: [https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process-2018-05-22](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process-2018-05-22).

OASIS also calls your attention to the requests in the Call for Patent Disclosure contained in the Open Project Rules.

You agree to promptly notify OASIS by email to [open-projects-cla@oasis-open.org]() if you become aware of any facts, changes or circumstances that would make your commitments and statements in this Entity CLA inaccurate in any way, or if you wish to withdraw from this CLA.
