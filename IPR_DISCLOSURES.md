This is a draft proposal for an IPR page that would be included for any open project. 
The top shows the page as it would appear for most projects that have no disclosures. 
The bottom shows what it would look like with disclosures included. Both include the 
call for disclosures documented in the Open Project rules.

## IPR Disclosures

This OP operates under the license(s) declared for each repository.

OASIS is not aware of any statements or declarations regarding IPR related to the work of this Open Project.

### *Call for Patent Disclosure*

OASIS requests that any party contact the OASIS Open Project Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of an OASIS Project Specification; and that any such claimant provide an indication of its willingness to grant a Specification Non-Assertion Covenant with respect to such patent claims, or otherwise to negotiate patent licenses free of charge with other parties on a non-discriminatory basis on reasonable terms and conditions.

OASIS may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so. OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in an OASIS Project Specification, or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights.
